  title: M-Agent API for Process Kill Experiment
  version: v1.0.0
  description: >
    M-Agent is a platform-generic, OS scoped agent for aiding with the injection and
    orchestration of the faults, as part of the LitmusChaos Experiments. It can
    also be used to inject chaos into any physical node installed with a Linux OS. 
    
    Process Kill experiment causes target processes, identified by their PIDs,
    to be killed in either serial or parallel mode.

      The agent endpoint is exposed at port **41365**, where the client can
      attempt to establish a connection, given the agent is publicly accessible.
      For the connection to be established, an authentication token is required
      which can be generated using the agent itself.

        "ACTION_SUCCESSFUL" and a "payload" of type object (Go Interface type).
        The payload can therefore contain any kind of object that may suitably
        be sent as part of the feedback.
